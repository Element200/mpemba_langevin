Distance functions between PDFs. All distance functions must satisfy the properties:
    1. d[p(x,t),π(x;T)] > 0 for all p;
    2. d[p(x,t_2),π(x;T)] <= d[p(x,t_1),π(x;T)] if t_2 > t_1 (monotonic nonincreasing-ness with relaxation);
    3. d[π(x;T_h),π(x;T_c)] > d[π(x;T_w),π(x;T_c)] if T_h > T_w (monotonic increasingness with temperature)
    
These are optimised to take in vectors of histograms and operate on the bins axis.

def L1(hist_1, hist_2, dx, axis=None):
    """
    Find sum |hist_2-hist_1|_i. Does NOT calculate the integral; inputs must be converted to PMFs before function is called.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hist_1 : 2D vector of numerics
        Some probability density vector (this will not fail if hist_1 is not a probability mass but the intended use case is for PMFs).
    hist_2 : 2D vector of numerics of same shape as hist_1
        Second probability density vector.
    dx: float
        Distance between bins
    axis : int, optional
        If hist_1 is multi-dimensional, the axis to sum along. The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        sum |hist_2-hist_1|_i. If this is less than zero or greater than two, hist_1 and hist_2 are not correctly normalised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hist_1 : 2D vector of numerics

    hist_2 : 2D vector of numerics of same shape as hist_1

    -------
    vector of floats
        KL distance between hist_1 and hist_2.
